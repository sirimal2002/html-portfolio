<p>it's a song base on the movie name 'Kill Bill' <br />
The woman in yellow shirt that I saw since I was young 
</p>
<h3>In my head by Nlve</h3>
<p>
    This one i found by chance once I sat at the cafe and in coincidental <br/> 
    the cafe opened it then i fell in love at that moment 
</p>
<h3>Hold on tight by Aespa</h3>
<p>
    This song Aespa sang for the movie named 'Testis' made by Apple Movie <br />
    it's really good i also fell in love with it's first time that i heard this music style<br/> from Aespa .
